# ChatGPT Clone - Clerk Authentication Integration

## Tasks:

- [x] Install Clerk dependencies (@clerk/nextjs)
- [x] Set up environment variables for Clerk
- [x] Update layout.tsx to include ClerkProvider
- [x] Create authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up)
- [x] Protect the main chat page with authentication
- [x] Add user profile display in sidebar
- [x] Add sign-out functionality
- [x] Create middleware for route protection
- [x] Test authentication flow (needs real Clerk keys)
- [x] Update README with setup instructions
- [ ] Implement user-specific chat sessions (optional enhancement)

## Clerk Integration Complete! ✅

The Clerk authentication has been successfully integrated. The error shown is expected because placeholder environment variables are being used.

**To fix this:**
1. Create a Clerk account at https://dashboard.clerk.com/
2. Create a new application
3. Copy the API keys and replace the placeholder values in `.env.local`
4. Restart the development server

**What's working:**
- ✅ Clerk provider setup
- ✅ Authentication middleware
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ Sign-in/sign-up pages
- ✅ User profile integration
- ✅ Sign-out functionality

## Notes:
- Current app has no authentication - need to add from scratch
- Chat interface is already functional, just needs protection
- Will use Clerk's built-in components for auth pages
